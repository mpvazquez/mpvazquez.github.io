			<p>Hi, I'm Marco, and I'm a full-stack web developer living in New York City. I recently graduated from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (WDI) in April 2014. The course was very challenging, and I learned so much more than I could have expected! Not only did I learn new programming languages, but I also learned important methodologies like the Agile Development Process, Object-Oriented Programming, Behavior and Test-Driven Development. The people at WDI were the best part of the program. Everyday I was surrounded by talented instructors and incredibly bright peers who helped support and motivate me through the course's ups and downs.</p>

			<p>I am originally 'from' Indiana and graduated from Ball State University with a B.A. in International Business with concentrations in Spanish and Marketing. After I graduated, I moved to New York to join a non-profit to do community outreach with a focus on the Spanish-speaking community. I was also placed in charge of managing the organization's online web presence including social media, generating original content, and control over the email communications to it's members. Little did I know, when I first updated the website and took a look at the page's source code, it would be pique my interest and start a budding curiosity about the development 'magic' that led to my career as a developer.</p>

			<p>My introduction to the New York startup and tech scene began at my second job at a non-profit organization that focused on facilitating networking opportunities for entrepreneurs. I was in charge of implementing and facilitating event coordination in New York. I am extremely thankful for the relationships I was able to cultivate with a range of aspiring and successful entrepreneurs. I saw all the exciting developments in the tech scene here and the opportunities to be a part of it. My first step was to apply to General Assembly, and I'm extremely happy that I did!</p>

			<p>I mentioned above that I was 'from' Indiana. I qualified 'from' because I was actually born in California and lived in several other states through the age of ten.  I don't remember living in California or many of the other states. However, because my formative and undergraduate years were spent in Indiana, I claim it as my 'from' for lack of a better response. That ambiguity doesn't exist for where I belong now. I'm an enthusiastic full-stack developer with big dreams. I am proud to call New York City home since 2010, but I could also see myself in another international hub filled with fellow dreamers, an urban lifestyle, and most importantly, Tech.</p>
